/*
 * Method Overloading :- allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameter lists within the same class. 
 * It's a form of compile-time polymorphism, where the compiler decides which method to invoke based on the method signature.
 * 
 * Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. 
 * Itâ€™s a form of runtime polymorphism, 
 * meaning the actual method called is determined at runtime based on the object type.
